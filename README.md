So this is going to be me replicating a page I found online. 

Here is the link:

Hopefully this goes pretty well.

I'm going to be doing this for the extra practice and then I'll be returning to The Odin Project and finishing out my foundations. Then, we will go from there.

I think it's been about a week now and I do a little work each day. I set up a couple boxes and customized some links to other pages. I learned about absolute position on a page and I played around with a hover effect which was cool. I think it's going pretty well so far. I can't access the font used for free and I have some trouble with the RGB values but they're pretty close and I'm happy with them. I'm going to save my progress to Github now and go to bed. This is really fun and rewarding. I am falling in love.

Okay it's been two days since the last update and I think im finished. It was fun.

Nevermind it was not fun because I finished and realized that MY SHIT IS FUCKED UP AND IT DOES NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY UNLESS IN FULLSCREEN AND IT DOES NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY ON OTHER DEVICES. FUCK. I WILL NOT FIX THIS BUT I WILL LEARN THIS FOR NEXT TIME. FUCK FUCK FUCK.
