    <h3 class = "light"> The Road to Enlightenment </h3>

    <p class = "lightp"> Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <br>
        DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers. <br><br>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the <br>
        tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators. <br><br>
        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the <br>
        masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new <br>
        and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "light part"> Participation </h3>

    <p class = "lightp partp"> Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are <br>
        modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, <br>
        but the example files are commented well enough that even <br>
        CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <br>
        CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on <br>
        working with CSS.<br><br>
        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not <br>
        the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never <br>
        worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn <br>
        more, and use the sample files as a guide. <br><br>
        Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy <br>
        locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and <br>
        please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS <br>
        file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an <br>
        archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we <br>
        choose to use it we will download it and place it on our <br>
        server.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "light req"> Requirements </h3>

    <p class = "lightp reqp"> Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited <br>
        to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen <br>
        Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable <br>
        by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS <br>
        validates. <br><br>
        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by <br>
        now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most <br>
        modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — <br>
        especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across <br>
        every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in <br>
        at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% <br>
        of the population). <br><br>
        We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep <br>
        objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual <br>
        themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.<br><br>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your <br>
        graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your <br>
        CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may <br>
        learn from your work.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "light so"> So What is This About? </h3>

    <p class = "lightp sop"> There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The <br>
        Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage <br>
        participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in <br>
        the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this <br>
        very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that <br>
        has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.<br><br>
        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a <br>
        hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a <br>
        way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can <br>
        truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able <br>
        to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike <br>
        have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always <br>
        push it further.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "light ben"> Benefits </h3>

    <p class = "lightp benp"> Why participate? For <br>
        recognition, inspiration, and a <br>
        resource we can all refer to <br>
        showing people how amazing <br>
        CSS really can be. This site <br>
        serves as equal parts <br>
        inspiration for those working <br>
        on the web today, learning <br>
        tool for those who will be <br>
        tomorrow, and gallery of <br>
        future techniques we can all <br>
        look forward to.
